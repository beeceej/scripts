# Install Go from the command line

## Usage

* `./install_go.sh go1.9.2 linux-amd64`
* `./install_go.sh go1.9 linux-amd64`
* `./install_go.sh go1.8 linux-amd64`

In general...
./install_go.sh $VERSION $ARCH

Utility installs to `/usr/local/.goconfig/$version/go` then symlinks to `/usr/local/go`

Before downloading install_go will check if the requested version is already installed

# Warning....
* This script requires root, and as such always ensure you're running what you think you're running... It hasn't blown up my machine *...yet...* but that doesn't mean it won't blow yours up..
* If there are any issues running a go installation from a symlink, I haven't found any yet


# Isn't this similar to [gimme](https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme)?
* yeah... but I wanted to write it myself.
